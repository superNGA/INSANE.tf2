 NOTE : 
	images uploaded here must be upside down, because the stb_image library decided to be a bitch and
	read the image byte array in the wrong order and inverting it will take too much brain power 
	which I currently not have much off and it will also require including new libraries which I don't
	want.

	sincerely,
