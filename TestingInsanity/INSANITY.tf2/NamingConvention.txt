Using CamelCase.

Function names start with their FIRST LETTER CAPITAL
Variable names start with their FIRST LETTER SMALL

variables start with a prefix, to make their data type clear to the reader.
The following are most of the prefix that are used in this code base.

"m_" : for member variables.
"_"  : private methods
"sz" : Strings
"vec": std::vector(s)
"v"  : for Vec3 ( float x,y,z; )
"q"  : for QAngles ( float roll, pitch, yaw; )
"i"  : Intergers
"fl" : floats
"n"  : Represents count of something ( ex. nNiggas : number of niggas. )

variable declared consecutively must be aligned with their names USING SPACES AND NOT TABS.

" NOTE : My english is not so good. And I am also retarded, 
so nobody call me out when you see me not following my own rules."
